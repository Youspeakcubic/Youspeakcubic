Hello my name is Anthony De la Torre, I am a front end developer currently mastering Javascript
and its many frameworks while trying to dip my toes in database and backend technologies such as SQL, and PHP.

Currently searching for a career opportunity to push me out of my comfort zone and make beautiful adaptive products with a team.
